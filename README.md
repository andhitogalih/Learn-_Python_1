## Python
Python is a general-purpose, versatile, and powerful programming language. Itâ€™s a great first language because Python code is concise and easy to read. Whatever you want to do, python can do it. From web development to machine learning to data science, Python is the language for you.

## Python Basic
### Introduction (variable and print statement)
### Input() function
## String Operations 


## Data type
A data type is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value. Python Data Types are used to define the type of a variable. It defines what type of data we are going to store in a variable. The data stored in memory can be of many types.

### Number
The numeric data type in Python represents the data that has a numeric value. A numeric value can be an integer, a floating number, or even a complex number.

####  int
The integer data type is a numeric data type that holds whole numbers.

####  float
The float data type is used for variables that have fractional / decimal values.

####  complex
Complex data types. It represents imaginary values.

### String
In Python, a string is a sequence of characters.
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

### Boolean
In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.
When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer

### List [ ]
The list data type is a collection data type that is ordered and also changeable. We can define this data type with square brackets [ ] in Python.

Ex : 
 ```python
   a = [1, 2, 3]
   ```

### Tuple ( )
Tuple is a type of list whose elements cannot be changed. Generally, tuples are used for data that is write-once, and can be executed more quickly. Tuples are defined by brackets and elements are separated by commas.

Ex :
 ```python
   a = (1, 2, 3])
   ```
### Set { }
Set is a collective data type that is unique, unordered and unchangeable where all values must be unique, and it cannot be accessed via index (because it is not ordered), and it cannot be edited (but can be added and deleted).

Ex :
 ```python
   a = {1, 2, 3}
   ```
### Union
The union method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified set(s).
### Intersection
The intersection method returns a set that contains the similarity between two or more sets.
### Dictionary
A dictionary in Python is a collection of unordered key-value pairs. Dictionaries can be used to convey small to large data. To access the data we have to know the key. In the Python Dictionary it is defined with curly braces and additional definitions:
- Each pair-key value element is separated by a comma (,)
- Key and value are separated by a colon (:)
- Keys and values can be any type of variable / object
